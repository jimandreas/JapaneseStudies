Role: Act as a Senior Front-End Developer.
Goal: Create a comprehensive, single-file HTML/CSS/JS learning tool for studying
Japanese vocabulary. The tool will be hosted on GitHub Pages or run locally on a Windows PC.
Content Requirements:
The application must feature two distinct study modes (switchable via tabs or a toggle):
Restaurant Menu: The top 50 most common Japanese restaurant menu items
(e.g., Sushi, Ramen, Tempura, Miso Soup, Edamame, etc.).
Japanese Garden: Common Japanese garden features
(e.g., Toro (lantern), Koi, Hashi (bridge), Shishi-odoshi (deer scarer),
Karesansui (dry landscape), etc.).
Functional Requirements:
Layout:
Use a clean, responsive 2-column grid layout.
Left Column: Japanese Kanji/Kana.
Right Column: English translation.
Audio Button: A play button next to the Japanese text that triggers the pronunciation.
Audio Engine:
Do not use external audio files. Use the browser's native window.speechSynthesis (Web Speech API) with the language set to Japanese ('ja-JP').
Include a fallback: If the specific Japanese voice isn't available, alert the user or try a default voice.
Data Structure:
Store the vocabulary data in constant JSON arrays within the JavaScript section so I can easily edit or add words later.
Format: { japanese: "...", reading: "...", english: "..." } (Include "reading" for Hiragana pronunciation if the main text is Kanji).
Styling:
Modern, minimalist aesthetic suitable for studying.
Use a legible font for Japanese characters (e.g., 'Noto Sans JP' or system defaults).
Highlight the row on hover to make reading easier.
Technical Constraints:
Single File: All CSS and JavaScript must be embedded within a single index.html file for ease of portability.
No Frameworks: Use Vanilla JS and standard CSS (no React, Vue, or Bootstrap) to keep the file lightweight and editable.
Responsiveness: Must look good on both desktop and mobile screens.
Output:
Please provide the complete, functional code for index.html.

Implementation Tips
Running on GitHub:
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Upload the resulting index.html file.
Go to Settings > Pages.
Under "Source", select main (or master) branch and save. GitHub will give you a live URL to share or use on your phone.
Running Locally:
Simply save the code as index.html on your desktop and double-click it. It will open in Edge or Chrome and work immediately.
